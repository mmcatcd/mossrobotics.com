# mossrobotics.com

## What is this?

The home for a robot made by Kevin McAndrew and Nico Amaya
over at [mossrobotics.com](https://mossrobotics.com).

Kevin wrote the source for the site so all complaints about 
the state of his HTML markup and God knows what else he has 
in there can go to him.

## Where is it hosted?

The site itself is being hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 
which is a pretty great service for hosting static sites. It handles SSL 
nicely and allows for lots of builds per hour than the likes of GitHub 
pages, has forms support and a host of other things extra things. I 
recommend you check it out if you're interested.
