            <p> We became interested in
                this field through the many challenges
                and competitions within the robotics
                community and also have much
                experience in designing robots. After
                looking at current bipedal solutions we
                found that many are very difficult to
                control mechanically which has led to
                complex and elaborate algorithms to
                control the robot in software. We have
                decided to take a biomimetic approach
                to simplify the robot's mechanics and
                software.

            <p> Current muscles are usually pneumatically
                or hydraulically operated. An example of
                this type of actuator is the McKibben
                air muscle (Seen below). They use an
                internal bladder and external cylindrical
                mesh. As the bladder is inflated it
                expands. The mesh tries to keep the same
                length to width ratio and contracts.
                These actuators can self lock, have high
                power ratings and high efficiency.
                However, they are also very expensive
                and heavy. For a 210mm muscle it can
                cost 100$ for a cheap one. The pumping
                equipment is even more expensive again.

                When taking a step the very first part is
                to shift your body forward. This results
                in a forward falling motion as the other
                leg is lifted off the ground. Many
                current robotic systems do not
                incorporate this 'dynamic'' technique
                into their locomotion.
                Using the most common method of
                direct driving each joint, the angle of
                the selected joint can be controlled.
                However with an artificial muscle the
                angle of the ankle and rate of your fall
                can be controlled or stopped
                accurately.

                Our system operates by using a pair of
                antagonistic muscles. When both
                muscles are contracted equally, the
                joint stiffens and forms a rigid
                structure. When both are relaxed
                equally then the joint becomes a
                flexible structure. Although some
                solutions are capable of recreating
                these muscle properties, there are few
                dynamically capable of change the
                flexibility through a range of stiffness.
                To achieve this properties of elastic
                materials can be used in an artificial
                muscle.
